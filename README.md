# Civico – Digital Civic Complaint Management System

Civico is a MERN stack-based web application that enables citizens to register municipal complaints online and allows authorities to manage, track, and resolve issues efficiently.

## Problem Statement

Traditional municipal complaint systems are often manual, lack transparency, and do not provide proper tracking or accountability.

Civico digitizes the complaint process, enabling real-time tracking, structured resolution workflows, and improved governance efficiency.
